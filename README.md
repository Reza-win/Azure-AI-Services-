# Azure-AI-Services-

In this exercise, you'll get started with Azure AI Services by creating an Azure AI Services resource in your Azure subscription and using it from a client application. 

The goal of this exercise is not to gain expertise in any particular service, but rather to become familiar with a general pattern for provisioning and working with Azure AI services as a developer.
